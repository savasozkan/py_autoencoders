# py_autoencoders

This code repository contains "AutoEncoder, Denoising AutoEncoder, Contractive AutoEncoder" written on python. The codes extensively use the lecture notes and base code infrastructures in CS231 Stanford (http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) and CENG 783 METU (http://www.kovan.ceng.metu.edu.tr/~sinan/DL/).

----Some features that you can find in the codes----
- "Euclidean" and "Cross Entropy" loss options are selectable in code. 
- Use of bias in computations is selectable.
- Shared weights are used in the course of mapping input to hidden layer and hidden to output layer.
- test.py includes small examples for three autoencoder types run on MNIST dataset.
- You should previously install required packages such as "numpy" from the web.
